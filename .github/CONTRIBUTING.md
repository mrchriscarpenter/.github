## Reporting Issues

Have you identified a reproducible problem or have a feature request? Here's how you can make reporting your issue as effective as possible.

### Look for an Existing Issue

Before you create a new issue, please search the open issues to see if the issue or feature request has already been opened.

If you find that your issue already exists, comment and add your [reaction](https://github.blog/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments). Use a reaction in place of a "+1" comment:

- :+1: - upvote
- :-1: - downvote

If you cannot find an existing issue that describes your bug or feature, create a new issue using the guidelines below.

### Writing Good Bug Reports and Feature Requests

File a single issue per problem and feature request. Do not enumerate multiple bugs or feature requests in the same issue. Do not add your issue as a comment to an existing issue, unless it's for the identical problem.

Please be sure to follow the issue template. The more information you can provide, the more likely someone will be successful at reproducing the issue and finding a fix.

### Follow Your Issue

Once opened, your issue will be added to the issue tracking workflow. Be sure to check back and contribute where possible.

## Contributing Fixes

After cloning and building the repo, check out the issues list. Issues labeled `help wanted` are good issues to submit a pull request for. Issues labeled `good first issue` are great candidates to pick up, if you are in the code for the first time.

If you are interested in writing code to fix issues, please open one pull request per issue and [link the issue in the pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue). Never merge multiple requests in one, unless they have the same root cause.

Be sure to keep code changes as small as possible. Avoid changes to code that are not relevant to the issue. Pull requests should contain tests whenever possible.
