# Reporting Security Issues

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, I encourage you to let me know right away.

I will investigate all legitimate reports and do my best to quickly fix the problem.

To privately disclose a security vulnerability, create a security advisory in the affected repository by visiting the `Advisories` section under the `Security` tab.

:warning: **Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests.**
