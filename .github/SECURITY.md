# Reporting Security Issues

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, I encourage you to let me know right away.

I will investigate all legitimate reports and do my best to quickly fix the problem.

Email [mrchriscarpenter@outlook.com](mailto:mrchriscarpenter@outlook.com) to disclose any security vulnerabilities.

:warning: **Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests.**
